# tic-tac-toe-starter-code

## Use the template code given here to start building a tic-tac-toe game.  
## This is the hardest challenge you've undertaken so far during this course!  Use what you've learned so far to do the following:
- Create a roadmap using pseudo-code.  Plan out the what needs to happen BEFORE you write a single line of code!
- While you're writing out your psuedo-code, identify constants, cached element references, etc. that you'll need in your application.  Put comments in each appropriate 'section' of code in the js file you've been given in this template.  
- Write SMALL, TESTABLE chunks of code.  
- Think about the game logic.  The hardest part of this exercise for most people handling win logic.  Think about how you can set up your game board in such a way that you're able to check it for a winner.
- Profit.  There ***may*** be a prize for the best tic-tac-toe game (to be judged on Monday).
